Using Bubble Sort Algorithm
Before sorting: [86, 97, 64, 91, 94, 26, 22, 26, 47, 92]
After sorting: [22, 26, 26, 47, 64, 86, 91, 92, 94, 97]
Number of swap: 27
Using Selection Sort Algorithm
Before sorting: [86, 97, 64, 91, 94, 26, 22, 26, 47, 92]
After sorting: [22, 26, 26, 47, 64, 86, 91, 92, 94, 97]
Number of swap: 9
Using Insertion Sort Algorithm
Before sorting: [86, 97, 64, 91, 94, 26, 22, 26, 47, 92]
After sorting: [22, 26, 26, 47, 64, 86, 91, 92, 94, 97]
Number of swap: 27
